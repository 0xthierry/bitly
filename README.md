# Bitly

The goal from this project is to learn new technologies and get more or less the same result from this [article](http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/7/14/bitly-lessons-learned-building-a-distributed-system-that-han.html) writen in 2014 by Sean O'Connor about the bitly infrastructure.

This project is also inspired in this [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgBPb59v5Fk&t=488s).

The project is in progress, so feel free to ask me about my decisions or suggest how I can improve that.
